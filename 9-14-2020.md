# Introduction to Code

[Slides](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/intro#content)

## What is code?

- General
    - Something that stands for something else
- In Computers
    - A series of instructions that tells a computer what to do

In coding the words we write get translated into a language that computers understand

## What is coding NOT?

- Coding is **not** mathematical
    - some logic (if/then/and/or/ect)
    - Mostly just counting ("do this 10 times")

- Coding is **not** solitary
    - code usually happens in teams

- Coding is **not** about finding the right answer
    - There are always more then one way to do it
    - There are tradeoffs to each solution
    - The hardest part of coding is *defining* the problem, not solving it

## What is Coding?

- Coding is
    - fun
    - frustrating
    - creative
    - communication
        - you and a computer
        - you and other coders
        - you and future you

## Languages

- Every program is written in a **Language**
    - like Java, Python, or C
    - HTML and CSS and SQL are languages
- computer languages are very specific
- different languages are useful in different areas
- We will be covering JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in this course
    - JavaScript is a very powerful language for web based programming

## Errors are Awesome

- Don't be afraid of errors
    - They are just the computer trying to tell you how to fix your program
- It's not all gibberish
    - Read it, Understand it, It will make sense

## What will we learn?

- The command line
    - CLI (Command line interface) aka Terminal
- Strings, Arrays, Variables, Objects, Loops, Files
- Run code interactively (in your CLI) or from a file    
- Make a simple website to run on your computer
- Push your websites to the internet and make them Live

## What if I know this already?

- Pair up
- Review is helpful
- Help your partner, or neighbor
- Promote yourself to a TA during lab time
    - You will understand it better through teaching it

# The Command Line

[Slides](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/the-command-line)

## Parts of a Computer
- Input
    - Keyboard
    - Mouse
    - Network
- Storage
    - Diskdrive
- Memory
    - RAM
- Processor
    - CPU
- Output
    - Screen
    - Sound
    - Network

## The Command Line
- How we talk directly to the computer
- You can issue **commands** to the computer
- the CLI is different then a GUI (Graphical User Interface)
    - a CLI is more primitive **and more powerful**

## LAB: Opening the Terminal

[This Slide](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/the-command-line#anchor/lab_opening_the_terminal) gives you a lab experminenting with your Terminal

## LAB: Interactive Caluclator

[This Slide](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/the-command-line#anchor/lab_interactive_calculator) Gives you a lab that will put you into the Node environment and you can write JavaScript here.

## Node is a JavaScript Engine

- an "engine" is a program that either *executes or empowers* other programs

## A Tale of Two Prompts

>Before you start typing, Look at the prompt!

- *the Shell* is the command line interpreter that the terminal starts with
    - usually consists of the username/location
- *Node* is a command line program that is launched *from the shell*
    - usually starts with >

## When in doubt, Try it out!

From now on, if you see text in `code font` try typing it into Node and experiment

`"pod" + "cast"`

If this doesn't print `'podcast'`, look at your prompt, you may not be inside of node.

## Directories

- a *directory* is a location on your hard disk
    - also called a *folder*
- directories can contain *files*
    - they can also contain other directories
        - aka sub directories

## Where am I?

- while inside terminal you're always "inside" a directory.
- you can type `pwd` and hit retrun.
    - this prints your file path at your current location

## Home Directory

- If you store your files in your home directory, things will get cluttered.
- For this class we recommend:
    - create a `code` directory inside of your home directory.
    - create a new directory inside of `code` for each lesson or project.
        - or you can create a `lessons` directory and a `projects` directory inside of your `code` directory

## Listing Directory Contents

- you can type `ls` and it will show the entire contents of the current directory

- you can also type `ls -al` this shows all *hidden* files as well as everything that `ls` would show you

## LAB: Home Decor

[This Slide](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/the-command-line#anchor/lab_home_decor) gives you a lab to practice

## Making a Directory

- you can use `mkdir` ("make directory") and it creates a new subdirectory

`mkdirt code`

this will create your "code" sub directory

## Changing Directories

- `cd` ("change directory") moves you into the directory

- `cd code` will move you into your `code` directory

## Basic Command Review

- `pwd` - shows the name of the current directory
- `ls` - shows the contents of the current directory
- `mkdir` - creates a sub directory inside of the current directory
- `cd` - moves into a different directory

> both `mkdir` and `cd` take a second word after for the directory they are referring to

- `ctrl + l` - clears the content of your terminal
- `code .` - opens VS Code from within the directory your Terminal is currently located in
- `ctrl + c` - kills whatever is currently happening in your terminal

## LAB: Make a subdirectory then enter it

[This Lab](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/the-command-line#anchor/lab_make_a_subdirectory_and_then_enter_it) is a lab to make and enter a subdirectory

## Files

- a file is a place on the hard disk for store things
- every file lives in a directory

## Text Editor

- A text editor is *like* a word processor but is *not* a word processor
- we generally want to open our text editor from inside of specific directories
    - we can do this by using `cd <directory name>` to get to the directory we want, and then run the `code .` command to open VSCode

## Source File

- Source code is the essence of the program
- source files are text files that contain source code
- to **RUN** a JavaScript program you type `node` and then the name of the program

`node hello.js`
Hello, World!

## LAB: Hello, World

[This Lab](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/the-command-line#anchor/lab_hello_world) is practice for writing your first a JavaScript program!

## LAB: Countdown

[This Lab](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/the-command-line#anchor/lab_countdown) is a place to practice writing a bit of code that will countdown from 10 to 0

## Command-Line Shortcuts

[This Slide](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/the-command-line#anchor/commandline_shortcuts) gives a handful of keyboard shortcuts for nagivating within the Command Line

# Useful Information

## Turning Autosave on
- while in VS Code
    - go to File > Preferences > Settings
    - Turn Autosave to on

# Values

[Slides](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/values)

## Values

- A **Value** is a location in computer memory that stores DATA
- There are many types of values
    - Strings
    - Numbers
    - Arrays
    - Dates
- Different kinds of values are called **types**

## Numbers

- A **Number** is exactly what it sounds like, any integer or decimal.

## LAB: Playing with Numbers

[This Slide](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/values#anchor/numbers) is a Lab to play around with numbers in code.

## Strings

- A **string** is an object that is a collection of characters
    - words
    - sentences

## Slicing and Dicing

- you can pull out parts of a string with the `slice` method

`"blueberry".slice(0,4)`
- this means to run the slice method and start at character `0` and end at character `4`
    - with this exact case it will return the world `"blue"`

> The slice() method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string.  
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice)

## String Indexing

- For most computer languages, counting starts at `0`
- the **index** points at the *space betwee* chartacters.
    - **indexes** are inclusive on the low end, but exclusive on the high end.

[This slide](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/values#anchor/string_indexing) gives a good example of how this is set up.

>QUESTION: Does this include spaces?  
ANSWER: Yes, it does. It also includes things such as the "new line" character, or when you hit `return`

## LAB: Playing with Strings

[This Lab](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/values#anchor/lab_playing_with_strings) is to practice using strings within a Node environment.

## Booleans

- A `Boolean` is a value that is either **true** or **false** 

## Operators

- Values an be combined or manipulated using **operators**
    - Plus (+)
    - Times (*)
    - Power (**)
    - DOT (.)
    - Assignment (=)
    - Comparison(===)

an Operator *sends a message* to the value
    - example: 1 + 2
    - this sends the number `1` the message `please add 2 to yourself`

## Comments

- if you ever see two slashes in a row, that means, "everything after these slashes are comments"
    - //(information)

- There are also multi line comments that are:
    - /* (information) */

- comments are messages to humans and will be ignored by the computer.
    - they are to keep track of what is happening in these sections of code and to make it more readable for humans to understand what is happening.

## Expression Evaluation

- Any snippet of JS Code is called an *expression*
- when JS encounters an expression, it tries to *evaluate* it which turns it into a *value*
- a simple expression evaluates to just that value
    - such as a string or number
- more comliecated expressions with operators keep applying operators until it gets a single value

## Return Values

- depending on what you're doing, your return Values may have different values returned.
    - They can be the same
    - they can be different
    - They can be a different *value* and *type*
    - they can return a special value

## Sidebar: Expressions vs Statements

- Expression
    - Code that can be evaluated
    - Code that has Value

- Statement
    - Code that does something

- Some statements have value
- Some statements have no value
    - Having no value can have surprising effects.

# Common Operators

[Slides]()

## Types of Operators
- Unary Operators
    - \+
    - delete
    - typeof
    - void
    - incrementers/decrementers
- Binary Operators
    - Arithmetic
    - Logical
    - Comparison
    - Assignment
    - Bitwise
- Trinary Operators

## The Unary +

The + operator can be used on an operand to convert that operant into a number

## Delete

The keyword `delete` is an operator that deletes whatever object, property, or element that is passed to it

## Typeof

The keyword `typeof` is a unary operator that returns the type of the operand it's called on as a string

## Void

The keyword `void` takes an expression as it's operand and causes it to return `undefined` rather then it's usual value.

## Incrementers/Decrementers

- ++
- \--

```
let myNum = 1
myNum ++ // => myNum = 2
myNum -- // => myNum = 1
```

>Note: Incrementers/Decrementers are only able to be used on numbers

## Arithmetic Operators

These take two numbers and preforms an operation on them

- These Operations return a **new** number
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Modulus
    - Exponent

## LAB: Arithmetic

[This Lab](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/common-operators#anchor/lab_arithmetic) is to practice using Arithmetic Equasions

## Logical Operators
Evaluates two values or expressions and returns a booleans
- && - **and**
    - evaluates true if *both* sides are truthy
- || - **or**
    - evaluates true if *either* side is truthy
- ! - **not**
    - inverts the truthyness/falsyness of the expression or value

## Comparison Operators

- These compare two values and return a boolean
    - \> 
        - Greater Than
    - < 
        - Less than
    - \>= 
        - Greater than or equal to
    - <= 
        - Less than or equal to
    - == 
        - equal to
    - === 
        - identity
    - != 
        - not equal
    - !== 
        - Really not equal

## Equals vs Identity

the double equals (==) will try to coerce the operands so they match if it's possible while the tripple equals (===) will compare the two values as they are

## LAB: Compare and Contrast

[This Lab](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/common-operators#anchor/lab_compare_and_contrast) is to practice using your Comparison Operators

## Assignment Operators

Modifies the existing value

- = sets the variable to the left equal to the value on the right
- += adds the value to the rigth to the variable on the left
- -= subtracts the value to the right from the variable on the left

## LAB: Assignments
[This Lab](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/common-operators#anchor/lab_assignments) is to practice using different types of assignments

## Bitwise Operators
- Treat their operands as 32 bits (binary).
- They are fast and powerful, but can be confusing.

[This slide](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/common-operators#anchor/bitwise_operators) gives more information on how they work.

## Ternary Operators

Also referred to as a conditional operator and is the only trinary operator in JS

```
expression ? valueOne : valueTwo 

// If the expresion evaluates to true returns valueOne, otherwise returns valueTwo
```

# Research and Reading Documentation

## Google

- Google will be your best friend.
    - Tell it the programing language you're in 
        - JavaScript, CSS, HTML
    - Then what you're looking to do
        - capitolize the first letter of each word.
    - Example: `Javascript capitalize first letter of each word`
    - Look for results that are below the sponsored results.
        - Stack Overflow and MDN are good resources
        - w3schools are okay
            - not the best but occasionally have some good tutorials
            - not kept up to date
        - medium is a blog post site
            - very solid resource
            - well written
            - well researched
            - pay attention to when the article was published
            - current version of JavaScript was released in 2016
                - articles pre 2016 won't be useful
- MDN
    - You can search `(topic) MDN` into google and it will bring up relivent information from MDN
    - Example: `MDN Array Methods`
    - On MDN
        - gives you an overview of what it is
        - gives you progressively more detailed uses as you scroll down.
        - Also provide links to other pages for more specific uses where applicable
        - Provides Syntax
            >example: *arr*.includes(*valueToFind*[, fromIndex])
            - Italics are to be replaced by variables,
            - anything in square brackets are not required but is an option.
